# My-first-full-website-build---RRwisdomhomes.com
This is my very first full-stack website project, built for a real-world client — a friend launching a wholesale real estate business under the name RRwisdomhomes LLC.
I took on the challenge of creating the entire site from scratch, despite having limited experience in frontend web development. The project began with basic HTML and CSS and evolved to include responsive design, embedded video backgrounds, a working contact form, mobile optimization, and custom branding using Affinity Designer.

Throughout this process, I used:

    Visual Studio Code + Live Server for local development

    Netlify for deployment and DNS

    FormSubmit to enable email submissions from the contact form

    GitHub for version control and learning how to push and publish my work

    Affinity Designer for designing the logo and favicon

    Browser DevTools to debug and simulate mobile views

    Coolors.co for the site's color palette

This repo marks a turning point in my coding journey. I learned not just how to build a website, but how to organize a real project, troubleshoot technical problems, and translate someone’s business vision into a digital brand.
